My prompts are quite messy but the interlocutor was
very helpful.</p><p>The first result is not very good and the final script needs more work,
but the core logic is done.
(<a href=https://twitter.com/edouardparis/status/1640256597711544321>Here a generated card</a>)</p><hr><p class=language-blue>Hello, I want to create a gobble card game.
How much symbols do I need to create a set of 50 cards ?</p><p>In a Gobble card game (also known as Dobble or Spot It), each card has a unique
combination of symbols, and each pair of cards shares exactly one symbol in
common. To create a Gobble card game with 50 cards, you&rsquo;ll need to determine the
number of symbols per card and the total number of unique symbols required.</p><p>The game is based on projective geometry and can be represented by the formula:</p><p>n(n - 1) + 1 = total number of unique symbols</p><p>where n is the number of symbols per card.</p><p>For a Gobble card game with 50 cards, you will have:</p><p>50 = n(n - 1) + 1</p><p>Solving this equation for n, you&rsquo;ll find that there isn&rsquo;t a whole number
solution. The closest solutions are n = 7 and n = 8, which result in 43 and 57
unique symbols, respectively.</p><p>So, if you want to create a Gobble card game with 50 cards, you can either:</p><ol><li>Create a game with 7 symbols per card and 43 unique symbols. In this case,
you will have 7 extra cards that you can use as additional variants, bonus
cards, or even for replacement cards in case some get damaged or lost.</li><li>Create a game with 8 symbols per card and 57 unique symbols. In this case,
you will need to remove 7 cards to have exactly 50 cards, but the game
mechanics will still work correctly.</li></ol><p class=language-blue>I have a folder with 43 image files in it, can you give me a python script
that read this folder and prints an array (the card set) of array (each
row is a list of the file names that will be the symbols on the cards) ?</p><p>Sure, here&rsquo;s a Python script that reads a folder containing 43 image files and
generates a card set with 7 symbols per card, where each row represents a card:</p><pre tabindex=0><code class=language-code-pink data-lang=code-pink>import os

image file (PNG) in that directory. The symbols are composited on top of each
other using ImageMagick through the wand library. You can adjust the left
and top parameters in the base_image.composite() method to change the positions
of the symbols. Note that this simple script assumes all image symbols have the
same size and transparent background. You may need to adjust the script to
handle different image sizes and backgrounds.</p><p>Please replace &lsquo;path/to/your/folder&rsquo; with the actual path to the folder
