Please do not contact/tag me on this network.</p><p>10 years ago, I signed up to twitter.com by curiosity.
I immediatly loved the format, the RT and the hashtags.
The requirement to be concise and the full public discussions
were appealing to me.</p><p>My first usage was to keep a technological watch, to discover
new projects like new programming frameworks, and to be confronted
to new scientific ideas. I was already aware of disinformation
and the basics of information warfare. I knew from the start
that in order to not become crazy, my news feed needed to be
maintained to stay in the scope I wanted. I discovered a lot
of very smart people and witnessed wonderful discussions.
It changed or confirmed my opinion about a lot technological
and social advancements, from nuclear energy and GMO to
abortion and minority rights. I learned what moral panic
is and how to see biases and irrational fear driven by ignorance
in my discourse and others. It may be surprising for a network
that encourages talk first, think later, but witnessing
multiple debunking a day made me want to not appear like an
idiot when sharing my thoughts to the world. However the first
duty of a social network user is not to be ashamed of his own
opinion and to share it; mistakes are human. It is to not
relay whatever stupidity confirming his bias that is clearly
unsourced.</p><p>Twitter became a tool for individual for self-promotion in a
more casual way than a business focused network.
I joined twitter at the same time I started my developer career
and I used the plateform to advertise my projects.
As a joined in 2020 a company releasing a lot of open source code,
I started to have some sort of peer recognition: people encouraging
my work, asking questions and tagging me when new related content
were published.
I enjoyed this a lot even if I did not want my work to be the
main content of my account.</p><p>Now, the place is crowded of bots and astrosurfing.
I do not have anymore a correct control of what
is displayed to me in my feeds. Coupled with anxiety disorders
I have, the whole angry experience is not good for my mental
health. I am sad of what became a plateform, I enjoyed so much
the past years.</p><p>I will try to write more content on my website and
maybe join later mastodon, nostr or bluesky.</p></div></section><aside><div class=sidenote><p>&copy; 2023 EdouardParis.<br>Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a></p></div></aside><footer id=footer></footer></main></body></html>
