I reinstalled Tmux.

I was using i3 then sway since 2017 navigate through windows panel and open terminal quickly on demand to throw commands quicky.
But after installing nixos on my laptop, I wanted to encapsulate libraries, required services and environment variables of my personal an work projects into nix files that I could load with `nix-shell`.
When opening a new kitty terminal window with sway, the new instance does not inherit the state of the previous shell. I can have a simple script in sway config on new window event that move the user to the working directory and trigger again the nix-shell command if a default.nix file is present. 
But I dont really like to rely on an extra configuration of my window manager to manage my programming process.

In fact, I was really inspired by [Mitchell Hashimoto experience with nix](). Quicly explained, a nix configured virtual machine delivers portability and reproducibility that guarantee a perfectly controlled experience on very good hardware, in his case Apple macbook Pro. What if one day I wanted to develop with my full neovim configuration, with all my shell aliases and scripts in a virtual machine runned on a lightweight Ipad? The time I will do the step to buy one, the performance will surpass that of my three years old laptop. What if I tried to code from a distant vps ?

In order to keep the environment simple, I dont want to have window manager dependency in it.
I want to try to develop and manage a project from one workspace pane, hence good old friend `tmux`. A `tmux` session open and close nested pane with the `nix-shell` inherited sandboxing.

I can also work again on my ossificated vim skills to manage everything from the editor in multiple buffer, but for now courage is missing.

# [ [ [ vim ] tmux ] sway ]
