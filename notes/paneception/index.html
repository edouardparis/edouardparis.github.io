But after installing nixos on my laptop, I wanted to encapsulate libraries, required services and environment variables of my personal an work projects into nix files that I could load with <code>nix-shell</code>.
When opening a new kitty terminal window with sway, the new instance does not inherit the state of the previous shell. I can have a simple script in sway config on new window event that move the user to the working directory and trigger again the nix-shell command if a default.nix file is present.
But I dont really like to rely on an extra configuration of my window manager to manage my programming process.</p><p>In fact, I was really inspired by <a href>Mitchell Hashimoto experience with nix</a>. Quicly explained, a nix configured virtual machine delivers portability and reproducibility that guarantee a perfectly controlled experience on very good hardware, in his case Apple macbook Pro. What if one day I wanted to develop with my full neovim configuration, with all my shell aliases and scripts in a virtual machine runned on a lightweight Ipad? The time I will do the step to buy one, the performance will surpass that of my three years old laptop. What if I tried to code from a distant vps ?</p><p>In order to keep the environment simple, I dont want to have window manager dependency in it.
I want to try to develop and manage a project from one workspace pane, hence good old friend <code>tmux</code>. A <code>tmux</code> session open and close nested pane with the <code>nix-shell</code> inherited sandboxing.</p><p>I can also work again on my ossificated vim skills to manage everything from the editor in multiple buffer, but for now courage is missing.</p><h1 id=---vim--tmux--sway->[ [ [ vim ] tmux ] sway ]</h1><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>vim</th><th>tmux</th><th>sway</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>New vertical pane</td><td>`` | <code>Ctrl+a %</code> | <code>Mod+Enter</code> |</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>New horizontal pane</td><td>`` | <code>Ctrl+a %</code> | <code>Mod+v Mod+Enter</code> |</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><aside><div class=sidenote>&copy; 2023 EdouardParis.<br>Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a></div></aside><footer id=footer></br></br></footer></main></body></html>
