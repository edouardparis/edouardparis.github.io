A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011–2019), it is the second show in the franchise,
created by George R. R. Martin and Ryan Condal for HBO. Beware, this
article contains spoilers</em>.</p><p>Nobody is safe in the realm of the Seven Kingdom, known for the
brutality and the trickery of its subjects.
Seated on the Iron Throne, King Viserys I Targaryen must handle the burden
of the crown and the tumultuous behavior of his brother, <em>the Rogue
Prince</em>, Daemon Targaryen. The Targaryens are the most powerful family of
Westeros, the continent they conquered with the fire of their dragons
and their knowledge of the dark arcane of Bitcoin.</p><p>As usual in the Game of the Thrones, our story begins with a death.
The Queen consort, Aemma Arryn dies without giving birth to a male offspring.
The King is incited by his advisors to declare his Heir to assure that
the royal line is clear to all. Irritated by Daemon provocations, The
King chooses his daughter Rhaenyra instead despite the old misogynistic
tradition.</p><h2 id=protecting-the-realm-funds>Protecting the realm funds</h2><p>Securing the fabulous treasure of the family is not an easy
task, but thanks to Bitcoin and cryptography the Targaryens do not have
to enchain one of their dragons on top of a mountain of Gold anymore.
Each Targaryen is educated from their young age to generate, secure and
hide (Sometimes between the scales of their own dragons) cryptographic
keys.</p><p>The Old King, Jaehaerys I Targaryen, did a secret ceremony with his
grand son Viserys after choosing him as his Heir. They setted up a simple
1 of 2 multisig and locked the family legacy in new Bitcoin outputs.
At this time, Viserys was a grown adult, married and aware of the
responsibilities to come.</p><pre><code class=language-ascii data-lang=ascii>                            │

be able to somehow get control of the funds.</p><p>During a secret ceremony in front of the old skull of Balerion <em>the Black
Dread</em>, Viserys creates a new descriptor and shares it to his daughter,
then moves the funds to outputs with scripts derived from it.</p><pre><code class=language-ascii data-lang=ascii>              Viserys

move coins to new outputs before the sequence runs out, either passively

King: Alicent. She gives him two sons: Aegon and Aemond targaryens.
Rumors spread to the country that Aegon should be the new Heir, but
Viserys does not change the succession order.
Sick by a mysterious illness and advised by his ministers,
Viserys wants to include the whole succession line in the bitcoin
